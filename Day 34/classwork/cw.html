            <h1>What we're covering
                Violence has spread beyond Israel and Gaza to the wider region, after Iran carried out strikes in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan, and the US struck Houthi targets again in Yemen amid ongoing shipping attacks in the Red Sea.
                Iran's foreign minister said on Wednesday that if there is an end to the conflict in Gaza, other attacks in the region will also stop.
                Israeli forces appear to have withdrawn from the area around a key hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, after their approach toward the facility late Tuesday prompted panic among the thousands sheltering there.
                Qatar said it has brokered a deal between Israel and Hamas that will see medicines delivered to Israeli hostages in Gaza in exchange for the delivery of aid to Palestinian civilians.
                Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Israel and Gaza.
